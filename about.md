I am a Data Scientist who has worked in a variety of roles across the sports betting, voluntary and e-commerce sectors. This is a technical blog writing about all things data science (currently all the articles are about cricket though), I also blog about any random thoughts that come to my head on [medium](https://bfern1994.medium.com), and I have a couple of old cricket articles on [wordpress](https://leftarmchinaman.wordpress.com/). To find out more about me, check out my first blog post or feel free to get in touch!
